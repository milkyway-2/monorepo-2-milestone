Milkyway2 is a tool designed to help stakers and validators in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems make safer, more informed decisions. 
The platform provides a real-time risk scoring dashboard for validators, featuring color-coded risk indicators and actionable recommendations for stakers. It also supports validator-to-staker messaging to enhance trust and coordination. This repository delivers a proof of concept (POC) combining a user-facing risk dashboard with backend staking verification. The backend integrates Polkadot staking module events and uses a Solidity smart contract to verify users' staking history, ensuring that attestations on validator behavior are both anonymous and limited to one per event per user.
